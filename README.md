Experimental conglomerate website using several different platforms and languages on OpenShift.

This is going to be a code repository for working demos of websites I build.  The idea is that I'm gonna utilize OpenShift's cloud service and create a custom cartridge similarly to an Amazon AWS stack.  I'm going to set up a front end HTTP webserver to act as a local DNS server to redirect to several web applications running on the same machine using some socket programming.  I'm gonna implement several mock applications using various frameworks and programming languages.



something like this:

user ---------> nginx ----------->
* Ruby on Rails on WebBrick using Watir/Cucumber/Rspec/SQLite3
* JEE on Apache Tomcat using Maven/Junit/Jenkins/Postgresql
* PHP CakePHP using MongoDB
* (Python using Django)
* (Node.js)
* HDFS, if there is enough RAM left
* a lot of front end stuff.
 


That's a lot of stuff so it'll probably take me a couple months to 1-2 years to set up. I'll upload them as I finish them.
